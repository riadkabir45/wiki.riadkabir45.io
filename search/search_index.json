First, it creates surface agitation, which allows gas exchange between water and atmosphere. This lets built-up gases from fish and fish waste escape to the atmosphere while tank water gets replenished with oxygen. Second, filtration creates water flow. Stagnant water is an ideal environment for harmful bacteria to breed, so filtration keeps water free from diseases. There are 4 main types of filters: sponge filters, canister filters, HOB filters, and internal filters. Details on filters are in the Filtration section.</p>"},{"location":"Wiki/aquarium/basics/1_tank_setup/#plants-and-decorations","title":"Plants and Decorations","text":"<p>If you want to lower maintenance work, plant heavily.

What is cycling?</p> <p>Cycling is, in short, establishing beneficial bacteria in your tank before adding fish.</p> <p>Your fish produce lots of waste, which is toxic to them in high concentrations. For fish to remain healthy in your tank, you need an ecosystem of beneficial bacteria to process these toxic byproducts.</p> <p>When you leave a tank for about a month with a small amount of fish food in it, the nutrients released in the water help build up this bacterial ecosystem.

You can also use house plants like pothos (which is much more efficient due to access to the atmosphere). Just place them in a pot with holes and make sure the leaves are above water level while roots are below. They will absorb most of the waste, provided there's a sufficient bacterial colony to pre-process it. This reduces the water change frequency by half or more, based on plant number.</p> <p>You can buy test kits for each water parameter.

The only way it can be damaged is through normal wear over time.
