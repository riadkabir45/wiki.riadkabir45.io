# Mission Impossible: Ginger Bug — The Second Trial

Last night I thought for an hour: Should I abandon my old culture and start anew? 

## ⏱️ What happened?
It has been 4 days (I lost track honestly 😃), yet I don't see any signs of progress. No bubbles, no foam, no smell for the last two days. It feels as if **the culture has abandoned ME.**

<!-- more -->

## ⚖️ The Great Debate

=== "Continue ☠️"
    * **Risk:** It might turn into a weird alcohol or mold.
    * **Waste:** I might just waste more ginger and sugar and get nothing.

=== "Abandon 😶"
    * **Risk:** I might lose a potential culture that just needed more time to "wake up."
    * **Regret:** Starting over is annoying.

## 🏁 The Final Decision
I decided to do both. I didn't want to risk the glass jar, so I grabbed an extra plastic bottle. I also fired up the new **weight scale** I bought a few days ago to get precise.

## 🛠️ Changes made this time
To ensure success, I’m changing the "Environment" variables:

- **Plastic Bottle:** Easier to handle and squeeze to check pressure.
- **Oxygenation:** Shaking vigorously for 30s.
- **Gas Exchange:** Cloth wrapped with a rubber band (no lid).
- **Precision:** Calculated ingredients (though I might have over-dosed all the ingredients 🤣).



!!! info "Stupid Insight"
    You actually don't need to be scared of introducing "bad" bacteria; healthy ginger yeast will usually out-compete everything else. Just keep the jar free of **oil, spices, and soap/detergent.** That’s the real enemy.
