# The Perfect Blog Post: A Feature Demo

Writing a blog is different from writing a Wiki. While a Wiki is for facts, a blog is for **stories**. This post will show you exactly how to use Markdown to make your stories look professional.

<!-- more -->

## 1. Using Admonitions (Pro-Tips)

When you want to give a "Warning" or a "Note" to your readers, use these boxes. 

!!! info "The Beginner's Secret"
    Keep your sentences short. Most people read blogs on their phones while commuting in Dhaka traffic!

!!! danger "Careful with Fermentation"
    If your Ginger Bug smells like rotten eggs, throw it out! Safety first.

## 2. Showing Your Work (Content Tabs)

As an AI Developer, you will often want to show "Old Code" vs "New Code." Use **Tabs** to keep the page clean.

=== "❌ The Old Way"

    ```python
    # Hard to read and messy
    def f(x): return x*x
    ```

=== "✅ The Better Way"

    ```python
    def calculate_square(number: int) -> int:
        """Calculates the square of a given integer."""
        return number ** 2
    ```

## 3. Organizing Steps (Checklists)

If you are writing about your **Aquarium Maintenance**, use a task list so people can follow along.



- [x] Test the water pH
- [x] Clean the canister filter
- [ ] Feed the fish (Don't forget!)

## 4. Deep Dives (Footnotes & Abbreviations)

Keep your main text simple. If you have a technical term like LLM[^1], use a footnote.

[^1]: **Large Language Model**: An AI system trained on vast amounts of text.

## 5. Summary & Engagement

Every good blog ends with a summary and a question.

| Feature         | Best For...                     |
|:--------------- |:------------------------------- |
| **Tabs**        | Code comparisons / Before-After |
| **Admonitions** | Pro-tips and warnings           |
| **Footnotes**   | Defining technical terms        |
