# Welcome to rklogs

Hi there! 👋 

Nice to see you landing here. This is my thought garden where I document my journey through code, nature, and everything in between.

## 💡 About Me

I am **Mokaddimul Kabir (Riad)**, a Computer Science graduate from **Brac University** currently based in Badda, Dhaka. 

By day, I work as an **AI Developer** at [JVAI (Betopia)](https://your-link.com), building intelligent solutions (actually looking for a better job 😉). By night, I am a hobbyist, a tinkerer, and a curious soul.

!!! info "Personality"
    I’m an **ambivert** 🤓. I value deep connections over small talk. While I enjoy my downtime, I’m like exploring riverside roads on my bike or getting lost in a forest.
